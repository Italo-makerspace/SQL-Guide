-   **DCL (Data Control Language):** Details the commands for managing user permissions, such as `GRANT`, `DENY`, and `REVOKE`.

-   **Aggregate Functions:** Introduces essential functions for data analysis, including `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, and `MIN`.

-   **Data Types:** Provides an overview of common SQL data types for storing numbers, text, dates, and binary data.
